                <h3 class="align-center">A tune that is great for christmas</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Half of us loves christmas tunes and one half loathes them. This playlist is as much for the Hater half as it is for the rest of you. It it simply put the best christmas playlist ever put together and is a honest try to pierce the heart of the other half of us with the spear of christmas tune love.</div>
<div class="posttext"> </div>
<div class="posttext">The journey begins with Moto Boy's magical version of Ave Maria, and what follows is a string of classic cozy christmas tunes. The list might be a bit heavy on the jazz side, but then again can that side really be to heavy? The name of the king of christmas tunes ain't Bing, Elvis or Shane, it's not even a king; it's a queen and her name is Ella. The wonderful Ella Fitzgerald found her way into the list with quite a lot of songs, as it should be. No christmas is complete without Jussi singing O Helga Natt(O holy night) for everything he is worth - pure gold, so he gets to wrap up this fantastic playlist.</div>
<div class="posttext"> </div>
<div class="posttext">Treat yourself with something good to drink, sit yourself down in a comfy chair and enjoy these mood enhancing carrols (that goes for you to, Hater).</div>
<div class="posttext"> </div>
<div class="posttext">Merry christmas and God Jul! <br> </div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Cende - #1 Hit Single</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">In Swedish we have a saying “Underbart är kort”. It roughly translates to Bliss is Brief. I seem to recall a proverb or some such about flames burning bright but it slipped my mind and I can’t be arsed to look it up. Just as instantly as we fell in love with Cende’s stellar album #1 Hit Single, with just that same instantaneous transition, our hearts fell with grief. We hadn’t even gotten enough time to properly profess our love before we learned that the band was to cease to exist. Luckily #1 Hit Single will last forever. It is eternally good and profoundly wonderful. Indi pop perfection. Simply the very best album of the year.<br> </div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Dan Luke and the Raid - Golden Age</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Golden Age is more than just a tune. It’s practically a whole album’s worth of music crammed inside the confines of one single and mind you, very coherent, tune. In of itself that is no small feat. Then, if all of that musical material happens to be A-grade plutonium, absolutely lethal on mere exposure ...well then you know you might have the no.1 tune of the year on your hands. Dan Luke and the Raid performs Golden Age with a lot of playfulness but at the same time with a nerve and sincerity that would perhaps feel contradictory from lesser artists or in a merely great tune. This tune however has the chopps to contain and shelter us from any amount of excellence-rays. All evidence points to the conclusion that Golden Age is infact a real-life-superhero who is, right now as I’m typing this, saving the earth from...<br> </div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Sinkane - Life &amp; Living It</h3>
<h3 class="align-center"> </h3>
<div class="posttext">Boy do I have sumthin’ sumthin’ for you, so we’ve been sitting on this stash of purified uncut contraband joy, all conveniently pressed into 180 gram black virgin vinyl slabs or if you so prefer lil’ shiny ‘bout 5 inch sized plastic discs, heck if you rather have it completely digitally we could have that arranged as well, whatever floats your boat. Sinkane floats our boats, cars and locomotives. <br><br> Fusing soul, funk and disco with african music such as high life is nothing new of course but the raw and uncompromising sound and attitude of Fela Kuti always placed his music well clear of pop. Osibisa sometimes tried to approach pop music but never this effortlessly. Life &amp; Living it is however much more than just a pop afrobeat record, so much more. Like on first hearing Telephone we had to double check that we hadn’t gotten it all wrong all our lives but no, the Bee Gees do suck, it’s just Sinkane wielding some kind of weird magic and getting away with that sort of sound. <br><br> Be warned! there is not one single tune on this record that isn’t highly addictive.<br> </div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Jason Isbell - If We Were Vampires</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Be it by chance or design but apparently sometimes even the Grammy jury get it right. This is however the only instance where anything on our lists have been nominated for a grammy this year; much outrage, very sad wow. Seriously though, This tune is profoundly philosophical as well as gut wrenchingly sad while also surprisingly warm. Inspiringly optimistic while terminally dark, gentle yet brutal. However most importantly it is epicly beautiful.<br> </div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Elder - Reflections of a Floating World</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">The first encounter with Reflections of a Floating World can be a real thriller. Two bars into the first track of Reflections it&rsquo;s settled, This is awesome! ...people talk about love at first sight but that is very scary. Will the feeling be reciprocated. In this case; will the album or atleast the tune be able to sustain this initial greatness? As the opening track Sanctuary thunders on it becomes more an more clear that oh man you can bet on it, and then as track after track on the record twists and turns their way through bars upon bars of ever more labyrinthian riffs, all initial promises are fulfilled. This is the third best album of the year. Don&rsquo;t worry it is just as good as it seems.<br><br></div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Sweet years - Fireproof</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">We have already covered the album on our album list, but there is one tune on it that deserves some extra attention. &ldquo;I'm tired of being people with you motherfuckers!&rdquo; - is an already classic line, in our minds. The main part, the awesome punk tune, of the song is over by the minute mark and then an equally awesome outro takes over. It does not conform and it is so splendid that it's in the top three. At #3 it&rsquo;s Sweet Years - Fireproof! <em>Perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection!</em><br>&nbsp;</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Mounika - How Are You</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Mounika has created an almost unique soundscape on this tremendous album. He deconstructs sounds and rebuilds them, the outcome is a lovely trip. It&rsquo;s not only the sound he plays with, it&rsquo;s also our nostalgia and our brains little safe place. It&rsquo;s a little like coming home. Cut My Hair could easily have been on our tunes list, but the album is so good it deserves it&rsquo;s place here. Mounika - How Are You is our 4th best album this year, with this fantastic chill-hop album.</div>

<div class="posttext">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dennis Leary has this famous quote; &ldquo;Happiness comes in small doses folks. It's a cigarette butt, or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm. You come, you smoke the butt you eat the cookie you go to sleep wake up and go back to fucking work the next morning, THAT'S IT! End of fucking list!&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We would humbly ask to change the list slightly: &ldquo;... It&rsquo;s a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm or a 19 sec punk tune from Otoboke Beaver.&rdquo;. Now, that&rsquo;s it, end of fucking list!</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mic drop.</span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also we love them, they can very well be the coolest band around. Please come to sweden!</span></p>

<br>
<div class="posttext">Much of the most anticipated as well as celebrated releases of 2017 where in some way shape or form related to Post-Rock. We had new releases from both Mogwai and Do Make Say Think as well as releases by electronical outfits bordering on Post-Rock such as Forest Swords as well as Bonobo. All excellent and surely worthy of this list were it not for Luciferian Tower just barging in, shoving the others to the side. 24 years into their career this is only Godspeed You! Black Emperor&rsquo;s 6th studio album. It would seem that they employ fairly strict quality controls on their material.</div>
