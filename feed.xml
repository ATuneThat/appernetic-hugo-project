                <h3 class="align-center">Younger Lovers - Whiskey and Water</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Don't say we never pick tunes you can dance to. Not after this anyway. If your heart holds, but the tiniest part of indie love - you will have those involuntary spasms, we call dancing - when you listen to this song. The singer has such a wonderful carefree way of singing and the guitar riff is just perfect, the tune is&nbsp;just great. We love the lo-fi production and we are in love with The Younger Lovers and their Whiskey and Water. That's the 9:th best tune this year, enjoy!</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Cloud Nothings - Life Without Sound</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">At first we were a bit sceptical, but it only took but a few listenings to get absorbed by this excellent album. It is pop, it is arena rock and it is still plenty of melodic punk. Many mornings have begun with a sing along session to Things are Right with You, in the car on the way to work. A great car album this is. There are plenty of sing and drum along tunes to choose from. The old saying; everything that Cloud Nothings touches is golden - still holds true. Our album number ten is Life Without Sound by Cloud Nothings.</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Les Big Byrd - Two Man Gang</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">This is the kind of tune that you immediately want to listen to again, you can not get enough. The straight beat and the sequencer is mesmerizing. If you don't understand Swedish the lyrics is like the Darth Vader version of the Eels song My Beloved Monster. We have been humming this tune since may and my daughter have even replaced the curse word in the opening phrase, from &ldquo;helvete&rdquo; to &ldquo;pipsv&auml;ngen&rdquo; (&ldquo;hell&rdquo; to &ldquo;diddly doo&rdquo;) and if they record it we will surely feature the family friendly version on next year's list. This is our number 10, Les Big Byrd - Two Man Gang!</div>
