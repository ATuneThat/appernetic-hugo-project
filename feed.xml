                <h3 class="align-center">The Dirty Nil - Minimum R&amp;B</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">If Jack White and Rivers Cuomo had triplets and left them to be raised by Dee Dee Ramone - well then you probably would have something that sounds like The Dirty Nil. It only features one new song for the year, but if the songs are this awesome it&rsquo;s still deserves it place on the list. Fuck Up Young is up there with the really great punk tunes. Minimum R&amp;B, perhaps, but maximum punk rock! We can&rsquo;t stop stomping our feets.</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Danny Vera - Snow in April</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Does dutch political crooner intrigue you? Well it should. Danny Vera has with this big band jazz tune created something that we think everybody should be humming on right now. He puts his finger in that nasty wound that just won&rsquo;t heal and pokes around. He does this to a perfect big band jazz backdrop, in such a way that you almost don&rsquo;t feel the pain. The smooth singing, wound picking dutchman is our pick as number eight on our top list.</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Sorority Noise - You're Not As ___ As You Think</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Sorority Noise shouldn&rsquo;t be on this list. They seem to take themselves way too seriously without actually making pretentious or even particularly ambitious music. However You're Not As ___ As You Think doesn't give a shit about that and just demanded to be on this list. Sometimes things that have no business being this good just is, perhaps to spite us. Anyhow that&rsquo;s how You're Not As ___ As You Think claim the 9th spot on this years best albums list, by being really really good.</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Younger Lovers - Whiskey and Water</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">Don't say we never pick tunes you can dance to. Not after this anyway. If your heart holds, but the tiniest part of indie love - you will have those involuntary spasms, we call dancing - when you listen to this song. The singer has such a wonderful carefree way of singing and the guitar riff is just perfect, the tune is&nbsp;just great. We love the lo-fi production and we are in love with The Younger Lovers and their Whiskey and Water. That's the 9:th best tune this year, enjoy!</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Cloud Nothings - Life Without Sound</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">At first we were a bit sceptical, but it only took but a few listenings to get absorbed by this excellent album. It is pop, it is arena rock and it is still plenty of melodic punk. Many mornings have begun with a sing along session to Things are Right with You, in the car on the way to work. A great car album this is. There are plenty of sing and drum along tunes to choose from. The old saying; everything that Cloud Nothings touches is golden - still holds true. Our album number ten is Life Without Sound by Cloud Nothings.</div>

                <h3 class="align-center">Les Big Byrd - Two Man Gang</h3>
<br>
<div class="posttext">This is the kind of tune that you immediately want to listen to again, you can not get enough. The straight beat and the sequencer is mesmerizing. If you don't understand Swedish the lyrics is like the Darth Vader version of the Eels song My Beloved Monster. We have been humming this tune since may and my daughter have even replaced the curse word in the opening phrase, from &ldquo;helvete&rdquo; to &ldquo;pipsv&auml;ngen&rdquo; (&ldquo;hell&rdquo; to &ldquo;diddly doo&rdquo;) and if they record it we will surely feature the family friendly version on next year's list. This is our number 10, Les Big Byrd - Two Man Gang!</div>
