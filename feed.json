The main part, the awesome punk tune, of the song is over by the minute mark and then an equally awesome outro takes over. It does not conform and it is so splendid that it's in the top three. At #3 it&rsquo;s Sweet Years - Fireproof! <em>Perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection!</em><br>&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0cDkNkmgdqyi5EtVB0yfxJ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

He deconstructs sounds and rebuilds them, the outcome is a lovely trip. It&rsquo;s not only the sound he plays with, it&rsquo;s also our nostalgia and our brains little safe place. It&rsquo;s a little like coming home. Cut My Hair could easily have been on our tunes list, but the album is so good it deserves it&rsquo;s place here.

We had new releases from both Mogwai and Do Make Say Think as well as releases by electronical outfits bordering on Post-Rock such as Forest Swords as well as Bonobo. All excellent and surely worthy of this list were it not for Luciferian Tower just barging in, shoving the others to the side. 24 years into their career this is only Godspeed You! Black Emperor&rsquo;s 6th studio album. It would seem that they employ fairly strict quality controls on their material.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2eOMttZbB9lBc9LLMj56xj\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

I have created a playlist with 12 tunes that I for one reason or another think deserves some extra attention. Let's get to it: <br>\n<h6>Culture Abuse - So Busted</h6>\nI just want to be eighteen with a mohawk riding a skateboard when I listen to this punk tune, but then again my life is so busted.\n<h6>Wilderado - Petra Rae</h6>\nThank you Petra Rae for this slow builder with great falsetto - goosebumps in the face!\n<h6>Vulfpeck - Baby I Don't Know Oh Oh</h6>\nCharles Jones playfulness at the end when sings harmonies with the instruments; dang!\n<h6>Diet Cig - Tummy Ache</h6>\nI&rsquo;ve been singing &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to be a punk while wearing skirt&rdquo;, all year.\n<h6>Meursault - Klopfgeist</h6>\nThis ghost story is so beautiful you might start believing in the other side.\n<h6>Nnamdi Ogbonnaya - let gO Of my egO</h6>\nIt&rsquo;s hard to describe this loco, totally crazy tune, don&rsquo;t miss the backing track; love it!\n<h6>Mattias Alkberg - Obeskjuten</h6>\nDeals with the sickening racist opinions out there, in a beautiful way; it&rsquo;s as good as it is important.\n<h6>Shallow Lenses - Take It to the Table</h6>\nThey are actually singing about my silly little life and I think they nail it, but no I wouldn't bet it all on black.\n<h6>Hanne Hukkelberg - Fall</h6>\nWhen the kid in the background shouts ; &ldquo;Kom igen nu...&rdquo;: I am indeed falling for this tune that everybody should be dancing to!\n<h6>Bolywool - Mirror Sky</h6>\nJust thinking of the outro is giving me goosebumps, you must listen to it - it&rsquo;s awesome!\n<h6>Tica Douglas - The Same Thing</h6>\nThe organ at 4:25; is golden, short and sweet, in this dystopian waltz.\n<h6>The Flying Stars Of Brooklyn NY - My God Has A Telephone</h6>\nMakes this non believer wish he has that funky telephone.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/roobine/playlist/1b60FtkzUxYOdFIIvDBf5o\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

Few albums are Heal. Our best estimate suggests that only one album actually is Heal. Luckily greatness is not relative even though sometimes as of a trick of light it might seem to be. Give Hard Love a good ol&rsquo; listen and let yourself find out just how great an album it really is. Or just let us tell you how great, it&rsquo;s the 6th best this year according to this list of ours. There.
