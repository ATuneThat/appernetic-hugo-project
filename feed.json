Few albums are Heal. Our best estimate suggests that only one album actually is Heal. Luckily greatness is not relative even though sometimes as of a trick of light it might seem to be. Give Hard Love a good ol&rsquo; listen and let yourself find out just how great an album it really is. Or just let us tell you how great, it&rsquo;s the 6th best this year according to this list of ours. There. Settled.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2aZ9ejc0Rs9kUmYzrz2D3l\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

That voice, the delivery, the songwriting, the voice, the strumming, that voice ...did we mention the voice. If someone emulated Janis Joplin it would still only be a copy but Jade Bird clearly IS Joplin; soon to turn 75 but somehow trapped in the body of a young British woman. One can tell since Jadis Birdjoplin is even writing just as brilliant but perhaps slightly more mature lyrics. Good Woman is our #6 song of the year.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0veTuOVnO1hWPJITgnhLBG\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

An album like Coat Guts from a band with no hype and not much media exposure - would have flown us by in older times. Thanks to chance and the internet, luckily, we found this superb band and this awesome album. Sweet Years let&rsquo;s the music go wherever it wants, supported by dark and sometimes very funny lyrics. If the music needs to change the mood or tempo - well it does. It&rsquo;s something of a rollercoaster to listen to this album, just hang on tight - like the real thing; it&rsquo;s so worth it! Is it punk or post-punk or something else? Maybe Sweet Years doesn&rsquo;t have a label and is just different states of mind. We are so happy to share the 7th best album of the year; buckle up!</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4HryuXndxBBkzC2smOvjvP\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

Sure some of her lyrics are even more aggressive than this but the pure brutality of the soundscape she creates on Wanna Sip should make it impossible for the tune to be even remotely as catchy as it is. Wanna Sip demands to be heard in every possible way and we sure hope that people do listen. It&rsquo;s self evident that this tune makes the top 10 where it holds down the 7th spot by the neck.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2sr67lIybeEr72VvmhAmkn\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

It only features one new song for the year, but if the songs are this awesome it&rsquo;s still deserves it place on the list. Fuck Up Young is up there with the really great punk tunes.

He puts his finger in that nasty wound that just won&rsquo;t heal and pokes around. He does this to a perfect big band jazz backdrop, in such a way that you almost don&rsquo;t feel the pain.

If your heart holds, but the tiniest part of indie love - you will have those involuntary spasms, we call dancing - when you listen to this song. The singer has such a wonderful carefree way of singing and the guitar riff is just perfect, the tune is&nbsp;just great. We love the lo-fi production and we are in love with The Younger Lovers and their Whiskey and Water.

It is pop, it is arena rock and it is still plenty of melodic punk. Many mornings have begun with a sing along session to Things are Right with You, in the car on the way to work. A great car album this is. There are plenty of sing and drum along tunes to choose from. The old saying; everything that Cloud Nothings touches is golden - still holds true.
