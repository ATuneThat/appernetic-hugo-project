A fair bunch of these are actually some of my personal favorites from the year but since the top 10 list is a joint effort I only nominated albums that I think fit our shared vision of what ATuneThat is all about.. Others like Rainer Maria just narrowly missed out due to tiebreakers.

If someone emulated Janis Joplin it would still only be a copy but Jade Bird clearly IS Joplin; soon to turn 75 but somehow trapped in the body of a young British woman. One can tell since Jadis Birdjoplin is even writing just as brilliant but perhaps slightly more mature lyrics.

An album like Coat Guts from a band with no hype and not much media exposure - would have flown us by in older times. Thanks to chance and the internet, luckily, we found this superb band and this awesome album. Sweet Years let&rsquo;s the music go wherever it wants, supported by dark and sometimes very funny lyrics. If the music needs to change the mood or tempo - well it does. It&rsquo;s something of a rollercoaster to listen to this album, just hang on tight - like the real thing; it&rsquo;s so worth it! Is it punk or post-punk or something else? Maybe Sweet Years doesn&rsquo;t have a label and is just different states of mind. We are so happy to share the 7th best album of the year; buckle up!</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4HryuXndxBBkzC2smOvjvP\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",
