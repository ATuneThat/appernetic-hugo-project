You Black Emperor - Luciferian Tower</h3>\n<br>\n<div class=\"posttext\">Much of the most anticipated as well as celebrated releases of 2017 where in some way shape or form related to Post-Rock. We had new releases from both Mogwai and Do Make Say Think as well as releases by electronical outfits bordering on Post-Rock such as Forest Swords as well as Bonobo. All excellent and surely worthy of this list were it not for Luciferian Tower just barging in, shoving the others to the side. 24 years into their career this is only Godspeed You! Black Emperor&rsquo;s 6th studio album. It would seem that they employ fairly strict quality controls on their material.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2eOMttZbB9lBc9LLMj56xj\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

One can tell since Jadis Birdjoplin is even writing just as brilliant but perhaps slightly more mature lyrics. Good Woman is our #6 song of the year.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0veTuOVnO1hWPJITgnhLBG\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

An album like Coat Guts from a band with no hype and not much media exposure - would have flown us by in older times. Thanks to chance and the internet, luckily, we found this superb band and this awesome album. Sweet Years let&rsquo;s the music go wherever it wants, supported by dark and sometimes very funny lyrics. If the music needs to change the mood or tempo - well it does. It&rsquo;s something of a rollercoaster to listen to this album, just hang on tight - like the real thing; it&rsquo;s so worth it! Is it punk or post-punk or something else? Maybe Sweet Years doesn&rsquo;t have a label and is just different states of mind. We are so happy to share the 7th best album of the year; buckle up!</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4HryuXndxBBkzC2smOvjvP\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",
