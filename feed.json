The straight beat and the sequencer is mesmerizing. If you don't understand Swedish the lyrics is like the Darth Vader version of the Eels song My Beloved Monster. We have been humming this tune since may and my daughter have even replaced the curse word in the opening phrase, from &ldquo;helvete&rdquo; to &ldquo;pipsv&auml;ngen&rdquo; (&ldquo;hell&rdquo; to &ldquo;diddly doo&rdquo;) and if they record it we will surely feature the family friendly version on next year's list. This is our number 10, Les Big Byrd - Two Man Gang!</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0vIRMyEEDErVychwk96cBf\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",
