They seem to take themselves way too seriously without actually making pretentious or even particularly ambitious music. However You're Not As ___ As You Think doesn't give a shit about that and just demanded to be on this list. Sometimes things that have no business being this good just is, perhaps to spite us. Anyhow that&rsquo;s how You're Not As ___ As You Think claim the 9th spot on this years best albums list, by being really really good.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4InFDPxlitl1pCVWdOjOkF\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

If your heart holds, but the tiniest part of indie love - you will have those involuntary spasms, we call dancing - when you listen to this song. The singer has such a wonderful carefree way of singing and the guitar riff is just perfect, the tune is&nbsp;just great. We love the lo-fi production and we are in love with The Younger Lovers and their Whiskey and Water. That's the 9:th best tune this year, enjoy!</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1tSz4d9WtSC1Jvz6QSAqRi\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

It is pop, it is arena rock and it is still plenty of melodic punk. Many mornings have begun with a sing along session to Things are Right with You, in the car on the way to work. A great car album this is. There are plenty of sing and drum along tunes to choose from. The old saying; everything that Cloud Nothings touches is golden - still holds true. Our album number ten is Life Without Sound by Cloud Nothings.</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/03IZHkwzDRhuHZypKeXB3e\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",

The straight beat and the sequencer is mesmerizing. If you don't understand Swedish the lyrics is like the Darth Vader version of the Eels song My Beloved Monster. We have been humming this tune since may and my daughter have even replaced the curse word in the opening phrase, from &ldquo;helvete&rdquo; to &ldquo;pipsv&auml;ngen&rdquo; (&ldquo;hell&rdquo; to &ldquo;diddly doo&rdquo;) and if they record it we will surely feature the family friendly version on next year's list. This is our number 10, Les Big Byrd - Two Man Gang!</div>\n<div class=\"spotifyembed\"><iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0vIRMyEEDErVychwk96cBf\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">&nbsp;</div>",
